# Random-Forest
In my project, I have implemented the Random Forest algorithm to enhance the accuracy and robustness of predictions. By utilizing an ensemble of decision trees, each trained on random subsets of the data and features, I was able to improve model performance and reduce overfitting. This approach allowed me to achieve more stable and reliable results for both classification and regression tasks, while also providing valuable insights into feature importance. The use of Random Forest significantly contributed to handling complex datasets and ensuring high-quality predictions.
